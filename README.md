# Convertly Take Home Challenge

Using the function getData() as your "api call", you will build out the mockups in the mockups folder using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript or jQuery only.

For this project, I utilized Javascript to complete the mocks of the cards.
>- Classes were added following BEM convension.
>- A loader was added to simulate a fake fetch request to the API.
>- Slight tilting when hovering on the cart.
>- Add responsiveness for mobile viewport.
>- Documentation of functions was included.
